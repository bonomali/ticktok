Pitched at dappathon Malaysia 2018  
Run deploy.html with Ganache setup. After configuration, run index.html.  

Ticket scalping market is eatimated at $5 billion a year*, where tickets were resale at multiple folds of original price. With our solution, ticktok, we aim to digitalize tickets where their integrities are promised with contracts stored in Blockchain, making tickets reselling impossible. Currently, our prototype app is built on Etherium network.
